# This repository contains files for automated soil sampling selection using the K-Means algorithm. The files in this repository include:

- Data preparation: This file contains code for preparing the data for analysis, including cleaning and preprocessing steps.

- Outlier removal: This file contains code for identifying and removing outliers from the data.

- Unsupervised sampling selection: This file contains code for selecting soil samples using the K-Means algorithm.

Notes: The covariates used in the script are commonly from Sentinel 2A-MSI spectral indices, DEM, and Landsat 8 OLI. The unsupervised K-Means technique used in this repository was derived from Brus (2019).
